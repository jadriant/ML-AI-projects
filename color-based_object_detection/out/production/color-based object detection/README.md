Compile: `javac Main.java` \

### Total Files:
1. Main.java 
2. Histogram.java
3. ColorSpaceConverter.java
4. BoundingBox.java
5. RGBImage.java

### SOME THINGS TO NOTE: 
- Apple image and object is not really working. It is able to detect the Apple, but there are some unwanted behaviors explained below. 
- For Oswald, Kirby, and Pikachu images, the program detects it well when processing multiple objects. (But if apple object is present, unwanted behaviors might happen too)
